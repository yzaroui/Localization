Localization
============

A simple localization singleton with convenience macro defined.
Relies on cocos2d-x FileUtils, but they can be easily replaced with arbitrary file io.

============

This code expects to find localization files in:
AppBundle/locales/Locale_*lang_code* directory and format.
